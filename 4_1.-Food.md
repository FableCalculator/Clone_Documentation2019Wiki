The main food indicator is the average calorie consumption per capita per day (kcal/cap/day). We also compute proteins and fats consumption in grams per capita per day. We start from the feasible total consumption for each product (cf. Feasible consumption), we multiply it by the share of the total consumption which is for food, we subtract food waste at the household level, we divide by the population number to get the average per capita consumption and by the number of days per year to get the average daily consumption (cf. Human demand). Finally, we multiply the average daily consumption per capita by the calorie content of each product. Kilocalories, protein, and fat content per product per country is taken from the FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS) for the year 2000.

In the FABLE Calculator, the main results related to food are presented in the FOOD worksheet. In the first figure (Figure 8), we display the evolution of the total kcal/cap/day both for the targeted and the feasible levels. A difference between the targeted and the feasible food consumption can be due to two reasons: there is not enough land available or production is not represented for some of the products included in the demand (cf. Appendix 1) because there is no data on production in the FABLE Calculator. In this case, a lower feasible consumption than the targeted consumption should be observed for the historical period. If the gap between the targeted and the feasible consumption increases over time, the missing products on the production side are expected to represent a larger share of total consumption and/or the targeted production cannot be met because of land constraints (cf. Land scenarios and Land calculation).
