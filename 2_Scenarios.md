# 2 Scenarios
_Worksheet(s) in the FABLE Calculator:_

_⇒ Scenarios Selection_

_⇒ Scenarios Definition_

We have established a list of parameters that can be changed through the selection of different scenarios. Each parameter and corresponding alternative scenarios are grouped by tables. By default, there are 10 parameters which can be modified through scenarios, each of which has between 2 to 14 possible alternative values. There are, therefore, thousands of possible combinations that lead to different pathways (Table 1). The user can select pre-defined scenarios or add new scenarios. To select a scenario, the user simply needs to enter "x" next to the scenario that they want to test (Table 2). There can be only one scenario selected per table. The parameters and selected scenarios are automatically updated by the SUMIFS and VLOOKUP Excel functions, respectively.
