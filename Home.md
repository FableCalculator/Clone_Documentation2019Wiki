*Note: The main structure of the current wiki follows the structure in the 2019 Documentation of the FABLE Calculator, published in the original [website](https://www.abstract-landscapes.com/fable-calculator). Additional modules were added to the calculator in subsequent years, and these will be marked accordingly throughout the wiki (i.e. updates for the Scenathon 2020).
