*Note: The main structure of the current wiki (first numbers in the chapters, 1 through 5) follows the structure in the 2019 Documentation of the FABLE Calculator, published in the original [website](https://www.abstract-landscapes.com/fable-calculator). Additional modules were added to the calculator in subsequent years, and these will be marked accordingly throughout the wiki (i.e. updates for the Scenathon 2020). Moreover, training materials, troubleshooting, sources, assumptions and suggestions to adapt the calculator to the national context will also be added interspersed throughout the main structure of the wiki in the next months, as an effort of the entire FABLE consortium to embody a community of knowledge.
