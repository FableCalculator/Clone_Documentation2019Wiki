# Appendix 5: Optional features

## Land cover map

_Worksheet(s) in the FABLE Calculator:_

_⇒ LAND_

_⇒ 4_calc_land_

_⇒ 4_data_land_

Release date: 8th October 2018 

This package provides guidance on how to include new data on land cover in the Calculator and use this information instead of the by-default FAO land cover data. However, depending on the format of your data, you might need to do slight changes to the proposed formulas (e.g. if the data on land cover is not split between protected and not protected areas). It contains 23 changes.

## Peatland

_Worksheet(s) in the FABLE Calculator:_

_⇒ LAND_

_⇒ 4_calc_land_

_⇒ 4_data_land_

Release: 20th February 2019

This package allows tracking peatland drainage because of conversion to agricultural land and associated emissions.

## Ruminant density

_Worksheet(s) in the FABLE Calculator:_

_⇒ Scenarios definition_

_⇒ Scenarios selection_

_⇒ 2_calc_livestock_

_⇒ 2_data_livestock_

_⇒ 5_feas_livestock_

Release date: 19th November 2018

This package introduces the possibility to vary the ruminant density per hectare of pasture i.e. introduces a new leverage of productivity increase related to cattle and sheep and goats. It contains 24 changes.

## Species loss indicator

_Worksheet(s) in the FABLE Calculator:_

_⇒ BIODIVERSITY_

_⇒ calc_biodiversity_

_⇒ data_biodiversity_

Release date: 19th November 2018

This package provides guidance on how to include the species loss indicator in the FABLE Calculator. It contains 24 changes.

## Water footprint

_Worksheet(s) in the FABLE Calculator:_

_⇒ WATER_

_⇒ 9_calc_water_

_⇒ 9_data_water_

Our indicator for water usage (SDG6) is water footprint1. Water footprint (WF) is the volume of water used to produce crops and livestock. In the Calculator, water footprint can be considered volume of water drawn from an annual budget, which is left up to the user to determine. The Calculator does not constrain the total volume of water used. WF is subdivided into three fractions: soil (“green”) water, surface (“blue”) water, and polluted (“grey”) 
water.
