# 5 Conclusion

The FABLE Calculator is a recent tool which has been developed over the past two years (2018-2019). It has been used to produce pathways at a country level and for the rest of the world regions, as described in the recently published in the FABLE 2019 Report (FABLE, 2019). Thanks to the scrutiny of the FABLE country teams and the FABLE Secretariat, and through several iterations of the Scenathon, many bugs and mistakes were discovered and removed. However, we are conscious that mistakes may remain and that there is room for further improvement. All users are welcome to report problems and suggestions for improvements to the [forum](https://www.abstract-landscapes.com/forum-fable-calculator) dedicated to the FABLE Calculator or by email to info.fable@unsdsn.org. You can also visit the FABLE page on the FOLU website for more information on the FABLE Consortium, as well as the FABLE Calculator [training website](https://www.abstract-landscapes.com/fable-calculator) where you can find more training materials and the latest updates of the Calculator.

The version of the FABLE Calculator which has been made freely and publicly available has been developed for “Rest of Asia”, one of the rest of the world FABLE regions. Specific country calculators have already been produced for: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Rwanda, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. If you would like to adapt the tool to your country, or another jurisdiction, you only need to replace the input and scenario data which is listed in Appendix 4 and in the worksheet called “Index Tables” in the FABLE Calculator. However, we acknowledge that this documentation does not provide sufficient guidance on scenario construction or how the calculator could be adapted to individual country/user contexts. There is also limited explanation on key formulas and their construction. A more technical documentation with “hands-on” exercises is under development in addition to a more user-friendly version of the FABLE Calculator. We welcome any feedback and/or collaborations to help us to move in this direction.
