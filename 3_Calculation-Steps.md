# 3 Calculation steps

The principle of the FABLE Calculator is to define several steps of calculation where, with the exception of the first step, all the other steps are dependent on one or several variable(s) that are computed in the previous steps (Figure 2). The numbering of the calculation worksheets in the FABLE Calculator reflects the sequence of the calculation steps. In each calculation worksheet, there is one or several Tables defined in previous steps which can be used in the formulas of the Tables defined in next steps.
