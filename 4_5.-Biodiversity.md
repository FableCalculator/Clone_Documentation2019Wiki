## 4.5 Biodiversity

_Worksheet(s) in the FABLE Calculator:_

_⇒ BIODIVERSITY_

_⇒ 4_calc_land_

The main indicator related to biodiversity is the share of the total land which could support biodiversity conservation (Figure 12). This indicator is the proportion of total land which is covered by forest, non-agricultural, and non-urban land areas to the country or region’s total land area. It includes new forest as well as land converted from other uses. By default, the target is set at 50% share of total land area (cf. FABLE targets).
