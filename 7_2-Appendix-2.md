# Appendix 2: Implementation rate of the scenarios

The implementation rate parameter is used to translate targeted values for 2050, as targeted values for each time step between 2015 and 2050. The implementation coefficient is the share of the difference between the current situation and the 2050 target that is assumed to be achieved in each time-step.
